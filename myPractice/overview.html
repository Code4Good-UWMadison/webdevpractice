            "If you ask me, life is all about who you know and what you can find. 
            When you live up in the Riftshadow Ruins, just finding food can be 
            tough. So you need to cut corners, you need to scrounge, you need to 
            know your strengths. Some of the beasts up there can kill you, so you 
            need a way to trap the weak and duck the strong. On the upside, the 
            ruins have history, and history is worth a lot to some people. There 
            used to be a palace there, where they had all these dark rituals. Bad 
            stuff. If you survived the ceremony, they would shatter a crystal and                 split your soul into pieces. They made great art though! Sculptures 
            and such. Let me tell you: sometimes you stumble onto some of those 
            old carvings. Take a pack full of those to town and sell them, then 
            get yourself food for a few weeks. If luck is really on your side, you 
            might find a Riftshadow crystal. Get it appraised and start asking around.                 Someone always knows some crazy fool looking for this kind of thing. 
            If all else fails, sell it to a Magus the next time one's in town. 
            They love that stuff. Still, whatever you do, be careful handling 
            those crystals. You do not want one to go off on you. It really hurts."

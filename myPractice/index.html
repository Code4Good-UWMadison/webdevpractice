            Meepo, the Geomancer, is a melee agility hero who is notorious for being
            one of the hardest carries in the game to play effectively due to his 
            heavy reliance on micromanagement. Meepo's defining ultimate, Divided We
            Stand, allows Meepo to create up to 3 additional clones of himself,
            (4 with Aghanim's Scepter), each of which has its own mana and hit points, 
            as well as individual cooldowns on Meepo's spells. The clones cannot use 
            any items besides the boots that the main Meepo himself wears, but each 
            clone can gain experience and gold additively with the original Meepo, 
            allowing him to gain levels and gold extremely fast. This means that a 
            well-played Meepo can gain experience faster than any other hero, capable 
            of reaching maximum level extremely early into the game and overpowering 
            his unsuspecting opponents; however, Meepo's greatest strength is also his 
            greatest weakness, as the death of any Meepo, including the clones, spells 
            death for all Meepos.

            Individually, each Meepo is very weak, but by combining their strength and
            spells Meepo can overwhelm opponents with their nukes and disables. A single 
            cast of Earthbind is little more than an inconvenience, but multiple Earthbinds 
            chained together can allow a Meepo army to keep an enemy permanently rooted to 
            the ground. Poof is a short-ranged area nuke by itself, but combined with the 
            clones allows any Meepo to globally teleport to any other Meepo, and deal 
            increasing amounts of damage when stacked together on the same target.
            Geostrike deals small damage over time and little slow by itself, but 
            combining the efforts of all clones can paralyze a foe and deal heavy 
            magical damage over time. With this skill set, Meepo can be everywhere on 
            the map at once, and can group up on an unsuspecting victim in a moment's 
            notice. Meepo redefines the power of numbers, and managed properly can 
            overwhelm the enemy as a one-man army.

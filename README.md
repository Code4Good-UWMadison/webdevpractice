### This is the homework
* Part 1: Write a HTML + CSS web page, you can recreate my example or you can make something else interesting if you want
* Part 2: Add Javascript to the webpage to make it more fun, js can be used to dynamically change CSS and HTML code. There is a quick and simple example: https://jialuogao.github.io/

1. Yuke add everyone to the repository webdevpractice on git
  Send me an slack/email if you want to add later or you did not come to meeting

2. Clone the remote branch onto your computer and start working
3. Create a branch on the repo and name it your name

4. Finish part1 and push to your branch as a commit
5. Finish part2 and push to your branch as a commit

6. Pull the newest dev and merge dev into your branch(just a good practice) solve the conflicts if there is any
7. Merge your branch to dev (don’t delete your branch this time)

8. Start a pull request to master (do not merge it)
9. Enjoy your day!

## You have 2 weeks to do this
## It's not graded but it’s a good practice if you want to help the team in the future

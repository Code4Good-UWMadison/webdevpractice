### This is the homework

1. Yuke add everyone to the repository webdevpractice on git
  Send me an slack/email if you want to add later or you did not come to meeting

2. Clone the remote branch onto your computer and start working
3. Create a branch on the repo and name it your name

4. Finish part1 and push to your branch as a commit
5. Finish part2 and push to your branch as a commit

6. Pull the newest dev and merge dev into your branch(just a good practice) solve the conflicts if there is any
7. Merge your branch to dev (donâ€™t delete your branch this time)

8. Start a pull request to master (do not merge it)
9. Enjoy your day!

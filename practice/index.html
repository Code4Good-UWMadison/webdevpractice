    <h1>Git Rules and Tips</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Git is powerful and we are using git to manage our code</li>
        <li>Master is automatically deployed to our web server</li>
        <li>Dev is our final working branch(combine everyoneâ€™s code before merging into MASTER</li>
        <li>New feature branches should be used for new features</li>
        <li>More sub branches can be used if needed</li>
        <br>
        <li>Write commit messages that make sense and helpful</li>
        <li>Fetch all and pull from the branch before push</li>
        <li>NEVER FORCE PUSH (unless you know what you are doing still not recommended)</li>
        <li>Merge all sub branches into one feature branch when ready</li>
        <li>Merge target branch(Dev, Master, etc)back into your branch and resolve conflicts in your own branch before merging</li>
        <li>Rebase/squash is recommended before merging feature branch into DEV</li>
        <li>Always update your branches to the newest before merging(fetch all and pull both target branch and your branch)</li>
        <li>Pull request is enforced for merging into Master, 2 people must review and approve the code carefully</li>
        <li>If you see anything wrong during the code review please tell the person/group or leave a comment on the review about the issue</li>
        <li>Fully test your feature before merging</li>
        <li>Delete branches that are merged on remote(you can still keep it on your local)</li>
      </ul>
